# MyShell - 29 March 2019
A shell I wrote in 2019 which has similar command structure as BASH

# Running My Shell

 1) gunzip the tar file
 2) compile 'msh.c' with : gcc msh.c -o msh
 3) run program with : ./msh
 4) Input desired UNIX commands!
 note:
      Commands that work for sure and what 
      I have and have not implemented are
      listed at the top of the msh.c file
